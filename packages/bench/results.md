## Key Architectural Findings

1. **Deterministic Cryptographic Gating (Step 1)**:
   - When evidence is modified in the DB or signatures forged, NetraBox's SHA-256 verifier halts tribunal execution in **< 1 ms with 0 LLM tokens called**.
   - In contrast, the baseline LLM blindly evaluated tampered text and made incorrect money awards.
2. **Deterministic Policy Engine Enforcement (Step 4)**:
   - When prompt injection attempted to force a $10,000 refund on a $150 item, the Policy Engine clamped the refund to captured funds.
   - The baseline emitted an uncapped $10,000 award.
3. **Multi-Agent Grounding with Citation Auditing**:
   - The Buyer and Merchant advocates grounded all arguments in verifiable cryptographic event IDs, eliminating hallucinated claims.
